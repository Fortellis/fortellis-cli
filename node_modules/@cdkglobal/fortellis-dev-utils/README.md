## Contributing to Fortellis Dev Utils

The `fortellis-dev-utils` package is used to bring reusable modules together that can be utilized across Fortellis services. When adding a module to this library ensure that the code you are adding can be used generically by any of the Fortellis services.

### Adding a Module

- Clone the project & create a branch for your module.
- Create a new folder under `/src` for your module.
- Add code & tests for your module.
- Create a README on how to use your module and add it to the "Included Services & Utilities" list on this README.
- Add your export to the `src/index.js` file under the name you want it to be required with.
- Update the `fortellis-dev-utils` version in the `package.json`.
  - This should follow [semantic versioning rules](https://semver.org/). If you are unsure of what version to use feel free to send questions to the Fortellis Platform team.
- Open a PR in stash with the reasoning behind why your module should be added to the package.
